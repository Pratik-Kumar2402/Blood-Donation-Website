Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:
<br><br><image align="right" src="../images/4.jpg" alt="image" height="300" width="300">
women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;<br>
children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;<br>
people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters;<br>
and many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.<br>
It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions<br> 
such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as<br> 
clotting factors for people with haemophilia.
<br><br>
There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use.<br> 
Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that<br> 
safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.

<b><i>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life.<br> 
A decision to donate your blood can save a life,<br> 
or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells,<br> 
platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</i></b>

>>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not more painful than losing a loved one that you may save by donating!<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is your civic duty.<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I know too many people who can’t give blood.<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because some day, I may need someone to do the same for me.<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you!<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if you need blood one day, you would not hesitate to take it, so why would you hesitate to give it?<br><br>
>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood donation is important because maintaining an adequate blood supply in our community secures blood transfusions for patients.
